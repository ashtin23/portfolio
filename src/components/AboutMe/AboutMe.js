                <p className="aboutMe">My name is Ashtin Latting and I was born in Fort Ord, CA. I spent the bulk of 
                    my childhood moving from state to state, and was fortunate enough to live in 
                    places like Texas, Virginia, Maryland, Colorado, Arkansas, and Ohio.
                    After graduating high school, I briefly attended The Ohio State University. After
                    my first stint in college, I left to join the U.S. Navy. I served four years in the Navy,
                    all of which were spent in Yokosuka, Kanagawa, Japan, onboard the USS McCampbell.
                    During this time, I was fortunate enough to visit places such as South Korea, 
                    Hong Kong, The Phillipines, Guam, Saipan, India, Malaysia, Singapore, and many other 
                    cool places. As you can tell, I love to travel!
                    After getting out of the Navy, I returned to the states to further my education. I attended
                    George Washington University, where I attained my BA in Economics in 2018. After graduating, I decided 
                    that I wanted to pivot towards a career in technology, which is why I opted to attend 
                    the Software Engineering Immersive course at General Assembly in Washington, D.C. I just recently finished up 
                    this course and am now looking for employment in the Washington, D.C. area, where I live with
                    my wife and two dogs.
